The original game can be found at http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/

This mirrored version is for educational purposes, either to download for your own offline education/use or to be played online from https://scriptguard.github.io/cookieclicker/ if you cannot learn on the original URL.


The purpose of this version of cookie clicker is so it can act as a backup and its also for me to test out stuff so it may not be 100% functioning properly
since il be tampering with some code so i can learn how to program better.

### How to update

go to https://github.com/scriptguard/cookieclicker and go to the README.md for the steps.
